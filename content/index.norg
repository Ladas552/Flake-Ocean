  Hi, this is Ladas552 speaking

  You are reading beta version of docs for my NixOS config, It will explain how it works and why it works!

  Not because it's complicated, but for people to learn and grow with me.

  Have fun reading nothing, because there is nothing to read.

  The site is build using norgolith and tailwind css. But keep in mind, the front end was vibecoded, so don't go looking for that source code - it's pure ass. 

  If you don't wanna read the whole thing just because it was build using an llm that actively destroys out planet. I can't blame you.

  But if you have some tailwind CSS or web knowledge please let me know to improve this site with human hands. Because I don't wanna maintain 2 different sites at the same time all by myself.
