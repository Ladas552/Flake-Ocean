# Why exist/public/name?
- I need a place to store my config to not accidentally delete it(happened before)

- I had problems when first trying out Nix. I hope this config could also help others as so many helped me

- Yes, it is a JoJo reference

# What are the plans
1. ~Write some shell scripts and nix functions to be cool and hip~
2. Write comments for not forgetting functions and what I did even config
3. Declare much more packages
4. Declare Nix with Neorg tangle
